- 👋 Hi, I’m @clerav
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot... Coding, Blockchain, Web-Dev, and almost all the topics in general
- 🌱 I’m currently re-learning web-dev, cuz I never properly went through it completely.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects really, at this moment. I just need to get used to GitHub and get proper development experience.
- 📫 How to reach me: crovtbox@gmail.com; Twitter/Telegram/Instagram -> @ravshanbxk
